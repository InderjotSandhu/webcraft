# üåä WebCraft Development Workflow

> This document outlines the development workflow, coding standards, and best practices for the WebCraft project.

---

## üöÄ **Guiding Principles**

- **Quality First**: Prioritize clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- **Consistency**: Adhere to established patterns and conventions.
- **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively and review each other's work.
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks to improve efficiency.
- **User-Centric**: Focus on delivering a high-quality user experience.

---

## üîß **Development Process**

We follow a structured development process from planning to deployment.

### **1. Planning & Task Management**
- **Tool**: GitHub Issues / Project Board
- **Process**:
  1. New features or bugs are created as issues.
  2. Issues are prioritized and assigned to a milestone.
  3. Each issue should have a clear description, acceptance criteria, and labels.

### **2. Git Workflow (GitFlow Hybrid)**

- **`main`**: Production-ready code. Only merge from `develop` during releases.
- **`develop`**: Main development branch. All feature branches are merged here.
- **`feature/`**: For new features (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`).
- **`bugfix/`**: For fixing bugs (e.g., `bugfix/login-form-validation`).
- **`hotfix/`**: For critical production bugs.

#### **Branching Strategy**

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch from develop
_git checkout develop_
_git pull origin develop_
_git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name_

# 2. Work on your feature (commit early, commit often)
_git add ._
_git commit -m "feat: implement user login form"_

# 3. Push your feature branch
_git push origin feature/your-feature-name_

# 4. Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge into develop
```

#### **Commit Message Convention**

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

**Format**: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

- **`feat`**: New feature
- **`fix`**: Bug fix
- **`docs`**: Documentation changes
- **`style`**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **`refactor`**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **`test`**: Adding or updating tests
- **`chore`**: Build process or dependency updates

**Example**: `feat(auth): add google oauth provider`

### **3. Code Quality & Review**

- **Linting**: ESLint is configured to enforce coding standards. Run `npm run lint` before committing.
- **Formatting**: Prettier is used for consistent code formatting.
- **Code Review**:
  1. All PRs must be reviewed by at least one other team member.
  2. Reviewers should check for code quality, correctness, and adherence to standards.
  3. Use PR comments for feedback and discussion.
  4. PRs must pass all automated checks (linting, tests) before merging.

### **4. Testing**

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and functions.
- **Integration Tests**: For testing interactions between multiple components.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: For testing user flows from start to finish.
- **Framework**: Jest / React Testing Library for unit/integration, Cypress for E2E.

### **5. Issue & Bug Tracking**

- **Log**: Use `ISSUES_SOLUTIONS.md` to document all technical issues.
- **Process**:
  1. When a new issue is identified, create a bug report in GitHub Issues.
  2. Once resolved, document the solution in `ISSUES_SOLUTIONS.md`.
  3. Link the GitHub issue to the solution in the log.

### **6. Deployment Strategy**

- **Staging/Preview**: All PRs are automatically deployed to a preview environment (e.g., Vercel) for testing.
- **Production**: Merging to `main` triggers a production deployment.
- **Rollbacks**: In case of issues, revert the merge to `main` or deploy a hotfix.

## üìê **Coding Standards**

### **TypeScript**
- Use strict mode (`"strict": true`).
- Type all function parameters and return values.
- Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/intersections.
- Avoid `any` whenever possible.

### **React**
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use component composition to build complex UIs.
- Use `memo` for performance optimization where necessary.

### **File & Folder Structure**
- **`src/app`**: App Router pages and layouts.
- **`src/components`**: Reusable UI components.
  - **`ui/`**: General-purpose UI components (Button, Input, etc.).
  - **`layout/`**: Page layout components (Navbar, Footer, etc.).
  - **`features/`**: Components specific to a feature.
- **`src/lib`**: Utility functions, helpers, and external libraries.
- **`src/styles`**: Global styles and TailwindCSS configuration.
- **`types/`**: Global TypeScript type definitions.

### **API Layer**
- Use RESTful principles for API design.
- Use consistent request/response formats.
- Implement proper error handling and status codes.
- Secure all endpoints with authentication middleware.

## ü§ù **Collaboration & Communication**

- **Stand-ups**: Daily check-ins to discuss progress and blockers.
- **Slack/Discord**: For real-time communication.
- **GitHub Discussions**: For longer-form discussions about features or architecture.
- **Documentation**: Keep `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` and other logs up-to-date.
